# Leetcode Problem Rating Project

![img](http://fc.dianhsu.top/lc?user=zerotrac2&loc=cn&req=rating)

The project has been deployed to [Github Pages](https://zerotrac.github.io/leetcode_problem_rating/).

Calculate the rating of the problems in leetcode weekly/biweekly contests based on [Elo rating system](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elo_rating_system) as well as [Maximum likelihood estimation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maximum_likelihood_estimation). It is not a 100% accurate result, but sufficient for evaluating the relative difficulty of a problem.

All the data needed during calculation are obtained by web crawlers. In order not to violate any potential terms and regulations, I will NOT open-source the code. Moreover, as the APIs are different amongst contests, the result does not contain the problems in 1st-62nd weekly contests.

Please refer to [ratings.txt](ratings.txt) for the raw data sorted in descending order. This will be updated every week after the contest(s).
